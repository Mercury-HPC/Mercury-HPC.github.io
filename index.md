Mercury is a C library for implementing Remote Procedure Call, optimized
for High-Performance Computing Systems. Mercury has support for remote
function calls which include large data arguments. Since code generation
is done using the C preprocessor, no external tool is required.

See <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation">here</a> for a quick
introduction on how to use Mercury in your projects!

Mercury is partially supported by DOE Office of Science Advanced
Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) research and by NSF Directorate
for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering (CISE)
Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF) core
program funding. Mercury is part of the
