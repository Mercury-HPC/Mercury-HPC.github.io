Engineers and scientists working in a heterogeneous computing environment
often want to distribute the various tasks of an application---such as
computation, storage, analysis, or visualization---to different types of
resources and libraries. Often, a technique known as Remote Procedure Call
(RPC) is used that allows local calls to be transparently executed onto remote
resources.

Using common RPC frameworks on a High-Performance Computing (HPC) system presents
two limitations, however: the inability to take advantage of the native network
transport and the inability to transfer large amounts of data.

To avoid these limitations, we developed Mercury---an RPC interface specifically
designed for HPC. Mercury builds on a small, easily
ported network abstraction layer, providing operations closely matched to the
capabilities of high-performance network environments. Unlike most other RPC
frameworks, Mercury directly supports handling remote calls containing large
data arguments. Moreover, Mercuryâ€™s network protocol is designed to scale to
thousands of clients.
